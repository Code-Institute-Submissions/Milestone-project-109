This city comes alive when the lights are low, the music is up and the drinks are flowing. Miami is a city known for amazing nightlife, and no wonder: the best clubs in Miami are among the best in the world, hedonistic havens where you can sway to Latin beats or throw down to thumping tunes from the world’s biggest DJs. But there’s more to Miami nightlife than that: There are also the best bars in Miami, which consist of late-night eateries, splashy cocktail dens and LGBT hot spots that keep us partying well after the sun sets on South Beach. So don't be afraid to get a little nocturnal.</p>");
