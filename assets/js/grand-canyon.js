One of the greatest engineering achievements in  human history, Hoover Dam continues to draw crowds 80 years after its creation. Hoover Dam is about 30 miles south of Las Vegas on U.S. 93 and many day trips can be taken from there. The dam is named after America's 31st president, Herbert Hoover, who played a large role in bringing the nearby states into agreement about water allocations, settling a 25-year controversy. Completed in October 2010, the Mike O' Callaghan - Pat Tillman Memorial Bridge offers spectacular views that were once only available by helicopter....</p>");

Located about 1,500 feet south of the Hoover Dam, the walkway on the bridge is approximately 900 feet above the Colorado River. One neat fact is that visitors can go from Nevada to Arizona after crossing the 1,900-foot-long bridge. There are plenty of informative placards before and during the bridge walk. Another interesting stop on the walk is the observation deck set above the dam affording panoramic views of the Colorado River and Lake Mead. The location also provides a bird's-eye view of the Hoover Dam facility, including an unobstructed look at the dam's mechanical components.</p>");

The trail is 9.2 roundtrip to Indian Garden, a welcoming refuge and natural spring in the midst of harsh terrain or you can hike another 3 miles further to Plateau Point. The 3,000 foot return to the rim is brutal for most hikers that underestimate the intense heat and rough landscape.
